Here\u2019s a workaround that\u2019ll keep everyone satisfied on both ends: we\u2019re dredging shrimp in cornstarch before giving them a light sizzle in the pan.

                "In a small bowl, mix together 1\u00bd TBSP mayonnaise (we sent more) and as much of the garlic as you like. Season with salt and pepper.",
                "Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until caramelized, 8-10 minutes, tossing occasionally. Stir in balsamic vinegar and 1 tsp sugar. Continue cooking until syrupy, 1-2 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from pan and set aside in a small bowl.",
                "While onions are cooking, toss together zucchini and \u00bd TBSP aioli in a medium bowl until wedges are evenly coated. Add panko, oregano, and a large pinch of salt and pepper and toss so that crumbs stick to zucchini. Spread on a lightly-oiled baking sheet. Bake in oven until panko is golden-brown, about 15 minutes, tossing halfway through. TIP: It\u2019s OK if not all the breadcrumbs stick.",

Add to pan and cook until burgers almost reach desired doneness, 3-5 minutes per side. Top each with Monterrey jack cheese. Cover pan until cheese melts, about 1 minute.",
                "While burgers cook, split buns in half and place on another baking sheet. Toast in oven until golden, about 3 minutes. Spread split sides of buns with ketchup and remaining aioli. Top each with a burger and as much onion jam as you like. Serve with zucchini fries on the side."

But we like to think that this is the burger that tops all burgers, thanks to oozy, melty Monterrey jack cheese and jammy balsamic onions. Oh, and we should mention that this patty comes with zucchini fries on the side, so you can get your fix of crispy, crunchy finger foods and a dose of veg all in one.",

                "Wash and dry all produce. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Mince or grate garlic until you have \u00bc tsp (you may have a clove left over. Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion. Cut zucchini into 3-inch-long pieces, then halve each piece lengthwise. Cut each into thin wedges.",
                "In a small bowl, mix together 1\u00bd TBSP mayonnaise (we sent more) and as much of the garlic as you like. Season with salt and pepper.",
                "Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until caramelized, 8-10 minutes, tossing occasionally. Stir in balsamic vinegar and 1 tsp sugar. Continue cooking until syrupy, 1-2 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from pan and set aside in a small bowl.",
                "While onions are cooking, toss together zucchini and \u00bd TBSP aioli in a medium bowl until wedges are evenly coated. Add panko, oregano, and a large pinch of salt and pepper and toss so that crumbs stick to zucchini. Spread on a lightly-oiled baking sheet. Bake in oven until panko is golden-brown, about 15 minutes, tossing halfway through. TIP: It\u2019s OK if not all the breadcrumbs stick.",
                "Wash out pan you cooked onions in. Heat a drizzle of oil in same pan over medium-high heat. Shape beef into two 4-inch-wide patties. Season all over with salt and pepper. Add to pan and cook until burgers almost reach desired doneness, 3-5 minutes per side. Top each with Monterrey jack cheese. Cover pan until cheese melts, about 1 minute.",
                "While burgers cook, split buns in half and place on another baking sheet. Toast in oven until golden, about 3 minutes. Spread split sides of buns with ketchup and remaining aioli. Top each with a burger and as much onion jam as you like. Serve with zucchini fries on the side."
