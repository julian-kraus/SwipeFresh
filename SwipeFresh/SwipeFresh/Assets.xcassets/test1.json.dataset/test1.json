            "description": "A juicy, seared steak is a sure route to maximal flavor with minimal effort. But when chefs want to really raise the steaks, they add a not-so-secret ingredient: butter. It not only delivers rich flavor, but also helps the meat achieve a beautiful, brown crust. To that end, you\u2019ll be basting sirloin in butter, garlic, and herbs in this recipe. The sides are no slouch, either: parsnip wedges roasted until they\u2019re sweet, plus tender spinach decked out with sour cream.",

Don't tell the Spaniards, but we think it's also a pretty great, quick and easy, one-pan stovetop recipe that can be enjoyed even in cozy and intimate settings. Filled with chicken, chorizo, and bright red peppers, our version feels like a meaty, savory, flavor-filled jubilee.",

Which is exactly what you\u2019re meant to do after serving it: you put your rice in a bowl, add the toppings, and mix it all together so that those flavors and textures combine in a glorious mishmash. There are plenty of flavors and textures going on here, too, like sweet carrot, juicy zucchini, and beef tossed with garlic, ginger, and soy.",
