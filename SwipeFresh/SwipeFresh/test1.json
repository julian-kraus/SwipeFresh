                "description": "A juicy, seared steak is a sure route to maximal flavor with minimal effort. But when chefs want to really raise the steaks, they add a not-so-secret ingredient: butter. It not only delivers rich flavor, but also helps the meat achieve a beautiful, brown crust. To that end, you\u2019ll be basting sirloin in butter, garlic, and herbs in this recipe. The sides are no slouch, either: parsnip wedges roasted until they\u2019re sweet, plus tender spinach decked out with sour cream.",

Thanks to fresh tagliatelle, which cooks faster than the dried kind, you arrive at al dente perfection in a matter of minutes.

Which is exactly what you\u2019re meant to do after serving it: you put your rice in a bowl, add the toppings, and mix it all together so that those flavors and textures combine in a glorious mishmash. There are plenty of flavors and textures going on here, too, like sweet carrot, juicy zucchini, and beef tossed with garlic, ginger, and soy.",

The chicken breasts are baked, not fried, and served over spinach salad with a freshly squeezed lemon dressing. It\u2019s got all of the cheesy, breaded goodness you know and love in a less over-the-top package. And if you do love it, you can order it again next week.",

Which is why it\u2019s perfect for this recipe, bringing a cool contrast to the chili-accented shrimp and warm jasmine rice. It even gets an additional boost from an infused basil olive oil, which creates a wave of herby aromatics.",

But we like to think that this is the burger that tops all burgers, thanks to oozy, melty Monterrey jack cheese and jammy balsamic onions. Oh, and we should mention that this patty comes with zucchini fries on the side, so you can get your fix of crispy, crunchy finger foods and a dose of veg all in one.",
